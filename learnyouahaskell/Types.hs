-- Each node is either red or black.
--
-- The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root can always be
--  changed from red to black, but not necessarily vice versa, this rule has little
--  effect on analysis.
--
-- All leaves (NIL) are black.
--
-- If a node is red, then both its children are black.
--
-- Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the
-- same number of black nodes. Some definitions: the number of black nodes from the
--  root to a node is the node's black depth; the uniform number of black nodes in
--  all paths from root to the leaves is called the black-height of the redâ€“black tree.[17]
